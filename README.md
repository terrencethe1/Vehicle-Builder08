  ## Description 
  
  Vehicle-Builder08 is a TypeScript-based application that allows users to create and manage different types of vehicles, including cars, trucks, and motorbikes. The application provides a command-line interface (CLI) for users to interact with the system, perform various actions on the vehicles, and manage their properties. Users can start, stop, accelerate, decelerate, and perform other actions on the vehicles. Additionally, trucks can tow other vehicles, and motorbikes can perform wheelies. The project is designed to be extensible and easy to use, making it a great tool for learning and experimenting with TypeScript and object-oriented programming concepts.
